        Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam was born to a poor Tamil Muslim family. He lived with his family in the temple city of
        Tamilnadu, Rameswaram, where his father, Jainulabdeen, had a boat and was an imam of a local mosque. At the same
        time, his mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife. Kalam had four brothers and one sister in his family, from which he
        was the youngest. Kalam's ancestors were wealthy traders and landowners and had vast land and property tracts.
        But with time, their business of ferrying pilgrims and trading groceries suffered huge losses due to the Pamban
        Bridge's opening. As a result, Kalam's family had become inadequate and struggled hard to make a living. At a
        tender age, Kalam had to sell newspapers to supplement his family income.


        <h1>Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam's Biography - Educational Background of Kalam</h1>
        <img src="https://leverageedu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-8.jpg" alt="">
        Although Kalam had average grades in school, he was very hard working and had an immense desire to learn. He
        spent a lot of time studying and had developed a particular interest in mathematics. Kalam left Schwartz higher
        secondary school after completing his early education and went to Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirapalli. From
        Saint Joseph's College, he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace
        engineering at Madras Institute of Technology.

        <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nixx1KUdR-0/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="">
        Kalam joined as a scientist in the aeronautical development establishment of DRDO in 1960, after graduation. His
        career started with him designing a small hovercraft. However, he was not convinced by his choice of a job at
        the DRDO. Kalam was transferred to ISRO in 1969, where he was the project director of India's first satellite
        vehicle launch. The satellite vehicle deployed the Rohini satellite successfully in near-Earth orbit in July
        1980. Kalam received the Government's LV and Slv projects between the 1970s-90s. He directed two projects like
        Project Devil and Project Valiant, which aimed at developing ballistic missiles from the successful SLV
        program's technology Kalam somehow convinced Indira Gandhi and sought secret funds for these aerospace projects.
        His research and immense knowledge brought him and the nation great laurels in the 1980s.


        Kalam then went on to become the scientific advisor of the defence minister in 1992 and served at the same post
        for five years before getting promoted to the post of principal scientific advisor to the government. His
        immense role in the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power. Kamal had now
        become a national hero, to be remembered for ages to come. However, the tests he conducted caused a huge uproar
        in the international community. Kamal put forward a nationwide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which
        according to him, was a fantastic way for transforming the stature of India in 20 years, taking it from a
        developing to a developed nation. The plan envisioned the progress of the nation by adopting advanced
        technology, expanding healthcare facilities, and emphasizing the education of the masses.

        Sir Kalam was entitled to be the 11th president of India. His term period of 25th July 2002 to 25th July 2007
        was achieved by winning a presidential election in 2002 with a massive margin of votes. National Democratic
        Alliances’ nominated him to be president and it was supported by Samajwadi Party and National Congress Party. He
        was lovingly called as peoples’ president as he had done uncountable works for the welfare of the people and
        through the entire country.


        He was brave and courageous enough to take decisions and implement them no matter if that was tough or sensitive
        or highly controversial. The “office of profit” is perhaps the hard Act that he had to sign. The “office of
        profit”, according to the English Act of Settlement in 1701 explains that no single individual who has a
        professional set up under the royal family, who has some kind of provision with or who is taking a pension from
        the prince has the right to work for the of the “House of Commons”. This will allow the royal family to have
        zero influence on the administrative conditions.


        He had also become one of the most talked-about presidents Rule in 2005 for imposing the Presidents’ rule in
        Bihar. Kalam expressed his wish to take up the position one more time but then later changed his mind.


        After taking farewell from the office, he shifted and commenced his career as a visiting professor at the Indian
        Institute of Management in Shillong. He served as an Aerospace Engineering professor at Anna University, Tamil
        Nadu. He also lit up educational institutions like the Indian Institute of Indore, Indian Institute of Bangalore
        with his presence and knowledge. Sir Kalam served as chancellor Indian Institute of Space Science and
        Technology, Thiruvananthapuram.


        In 2012, he introduced a program called “What Can I Give?” focusing on the theme of eradicating corruption from
        the country.
